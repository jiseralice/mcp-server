                       Automate your browser with AI.

About

   Browser MCP is an MCP server + Chrome extension that allows you to
   automate your browser using AI applications like VS Code, Claude,
   Cursor, and Windsurf.

Features

     * ‚ö° Fast: Automation happens locally on your machine, resulting in
       better performance without network latency.
     * üîí Private: Since automation happens locally, your browser activity
       stays on your device and isn't sent to remote servers.
     * üë§ Logged In: Uses your existing browser profile, keeping you logged
       into all your services.
     * ü•∑üèº Stealth: Avoids basic bot detection and CAPTCHAs by using your
       real browser fingerprint.

Contributing

   This repo contains all the core MCP code for Browser MCP, but currently
   cannot yet be built on its own due to dependencies on utils and types
   from the monorepo where it's developed.
