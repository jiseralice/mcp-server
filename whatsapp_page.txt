WhatsApp MCP Server

   This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WhatsApp.

   With this you can search and read your personal Whatsapp messages
   (including images, videos, documents, and audio messages), search your
   contacts and send messages to either individuals or groups. You can
   also send media files including images, videos, documents, and audio
   messages.

   It connects to your personal WhatsApp account directly via the Whatsapp
   web multidevice API (using the [106]whatsmeow library). All your
   messages are stored locally in a SQLite database and only sent to an
   LLM (such as Claude) when the agent accesses them through tools (which
   you control).

   Here's an example of what you can do when it's connected to Claude.

Installation

Prerequisites

     * Go
     * Python 3.6+
     * Anthropic Claude Desktop app (or Cursor)
     * UV (Python package manager), install with curl -LsSf
       https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     * FFmpeg (optional) - Only needed for audio messages. If you want to
       send audio files as playable WhatsApp voice messages, they must be
       in .ogg Opus format. With FFmpeg installed, the MCP server will
       automatically convert non-Opus audio files. Without FFmpeg, you can
       still send raw audio files using the send_file tool.
