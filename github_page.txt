What is MCP?

   [130]MCP is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely
   interact with local and remote resources through standardized server
   implementations. This list focuses on production-ready and experimental
   MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database
   connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

Clients

   Checkout [131]awesome-mcp-clients and [132]glama.ai/mcp/clients.

   Tip

   [133]Glama Chat is a multi-modal AI client with MCP support & [134]AI
   gateway.

   Note

   Confused about Local 🏠 vs Cloud ☁️?
     * Use local when MCP server is talking to a locally installed
       software, e.g. taking control over Chrome browser.
     * Use network when MCP server is talking to remote APIs, e.g. weather
       API.
