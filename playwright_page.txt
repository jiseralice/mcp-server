Playwright MCP

   A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation
   capabilities using [136]Playwright. This server enables LLMs to
   interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots,
   bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

Key Features

     * Fast and lightweight. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not
       pixel-based input.
     * LLM-friendly. No vision models needed, operates purely on
       structured data.
     * Deterministic tool application. Avoids ambiguity common with
       screenshot-based approaches.

Requirements

     * Node.js 18 or newer
     * VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop or any other MCP client

Getting started

   First, install the Playwright MCP server with your client. A typical
   configuration looks like this:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
